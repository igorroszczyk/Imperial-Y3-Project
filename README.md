Low Cost, Modular Light Source for Fluorescence Microscopy

Fluorescence microscopy is a ubiquitous tool in biomedical research, enabling the
study of cellular and tissue structures in addition to electrical and chemical signaling
pathways. While commercial fluorescence microscopes exist, accessibility is hindered
by the high expense of conventional light sources, such as mercury and halogen-arc
lamps, and their inflexible designs whereby individual wavelengths of light must be
replaced. We have designed a modular, cost-effective LED light source utilising simple,
off-the-shelf components.
